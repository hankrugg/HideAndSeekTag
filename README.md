# Hide and Seek Tag

A simple text-based console game where you play **tag** against a bot using `WASD` controls.

## How to Play
- You control the **player** using the following keys:  
  - `W` - Move up  
  - `A` - Move left  
  - `S` - Move down  
  - `D` - Move right  
- The **bot** will try to chase or evade you based on its behavior.  
- The game ends when the **tagger** successfully **tags** the other player.

## Features
- Simple grid-based movement
- A bot that actively tries to chase or avoid you
- Text-based visualization of the game state
- Endless replayability
